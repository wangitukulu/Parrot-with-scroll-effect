        <h1>The Parrot</h1>
        <p>
            Parrots are some of the most spectacular and intriguing birds in the world!  Due to their intelligence and 
            highly social nature, parrots also have the ability to make wonderful pets.  Given proper training and care, parrots can make excellent companions due to their desire to live as part of even a human flock*.
            Parrots are a very diverse group of birds that can vary dramatically in size and color. For example, parrots range in size from the smallest Buff-faced Pygmy Parrot of New Guinea (3-4 inches) to the largest  parrot, 
            the Hyacinth Macaw of South America (40 inches).
            Parrots live in a variety of habitats ranging from hot, humid rainforests to alpine mountains!  They also have wide variations in their diets and nesting habits.
            Did you know that not all parrots fly! For example, the ground dwelling Kakapo of New Zealand spends its entire life hopping on the ground and climbing in trees.

            Parrots come from a wide variety of habitats around the world including tropical rainforests, savannas and grasslands.
            There is even a parrot called the Kea that lives in the snowy mountains of New Zealand. 
            Birds depend on their habitats to provide food, water, shelter and nesting sites. Birds adapt to their environments in ways that enable them to survive. 
            Although most people think of parrots as living in a rainforest, the fact is that some parrots also thrive in desert, alpine, grasslands and even urban environments!

            In general, parrots eat a wide variety of foods depending on their native habitat and what is available to them. 
            Most parrots eat raw foods such as fruits and vegetable matter, nuts, grains, seeds, sprouts, berries, flowers, pollen, insects and larvae. 
            Some parrots are very specialized feeders and eat only specific things. Others are considered opportunistic feeders because they eat whatever is available. 
            Many parrot species are considered pests because large flocks often destroy entire farm crops.
